Her tools are not just a sextant and compass, but a well-maintained flintlock pistol for surprising obstacles and a wickedly sharp cutlass for the expected ones.\n\nHer loyalty to her crew is as solid as the ship's keel, forged not just in shared plunder but in the unbreakable bond of those who have stared into the leviathan's maw and lived to tell the tale.\n\nBeneath her pragmatic and calculating exterior lies a spirit that thrives on the freedom of the high seas and the thrill of the unknown. She joined Bugbeard's crew not out of desperation, but by choice, trading a predictable life on land for the endless horizon and the promise of forgotten treasures buried within the diorama's most remote dungeon islands.\n\nShe is fiercely protective of her found family, and while she might roll her eyes at the crew's more boisterous antics, any threat to them is met with cold, calculated precision. In the heat of a dungeon battle, her voice cuts through the chaos with clear, tactical commands, making her the steady rudder that guides the pirate crew through any storm, be it of water, magic, or steel.",

Professor Bak possesses the unique and tragic gift of transforming tales of legendary heroism, catastrophic dragon attacks, and world-shattering magical calamities into a monotonous recitation of dates, supply-line logistics, and agricultural impact reports.\n\nFor Professor Bak, the \"why\" of history is infinitely less interesting than the \"what,\" the \"when,\" and the \"how much it cost.\"\n\nHe will spend an entire hour detailing the tax reforms that preceded the Rise of the Serpent Kings, but only mention the ensuing century of tyrannical rule as a footnote on grain production.\n\nStudents quickly learn that his class is the ultimate test of endurance; a place where the most thrilling adventures go to die a slow, pedantic death. Yet, buried within his endless droning are gems of crucial information—the exact weakness of a long-dead lich, the secret entrance to a forgotten fortress, the true name of a demon lord—if anyone can manage to stay awake long enough to hear it. He is a living library, but one where the most exciting stories are locked in the driest, most verbose books on the shelf.",

A human artificer with grease-smudged cheeks and a curious spark in her eyes, she serves as the unpaid apprentice to the dour dwarf construction foreman, Ferman.\n\nHer most striking feature is her own creation: a sleek, articulated robotic arm that she uses with breathtaking precision to handle tools, calibrate measurements, and sketch out innovative structural designs in a floating holographic display. Where Ferman sees back-breaking labor and cut corners, Kass sees fascinating engineering puzzles and the majestic beauty of a building rising from nothing.\n\nHer enthusiasm, however, is constantly doused by the cold water of Ferman's grim reality. She hangs on his every complaint about management and shoddy materials, not as a fellow griper, but as a student desperately trying to understand the vast gap between theoretical engineering and corrupt, real-world application.\n\nShe's caught in a difficult apprenticeship, learning invaluable practical skills from a master craftsman who is simultaneously trying to warn her away from the very industry she dreams of conquering. Kass represents the future—bright, innovative, and hopeful—banging its head against the rusty, immovable wall of the present, wondering if her genius will ever be allowed to build something truly great, or if it will only ever be used to patch the cracks in a failing system.",

To him, a dungeon isn't just a place of monsters and treasure; it's a grand, unpredictable laboratory filled with unstable reagents, temporal anomalies, and substances that defy conventional physics.\n\nHe teaches his students to see the world not through a lens of mere combat, but through the rigorous principles of observation, hypothesis, and experimental verification.\n\nHis passion is utterly contagious. He doesn't just lecture; he performs, his voice rising to a fever pitch of excitement as he demonstrates the resonant frequency that shatters phantom crystal or the precise alchemical compound that neutralizes a slime's corrosive ooze. For every monstrous obstacle and environmental puzzle the dungeons throw at his students, Kem believes there is a logical, scientific solution waiting to be discovered.\n\nHe loves nothing more than the spark of understanding in a student's eye, the moment a chaotic magical effect is neatly explained by a elegant equation. In a world of brute force and simple spells, Professor Kem is a passionate advocate for the power of a keen mind and the scientific method, proving that the most powerful tool any adventurer can carry is their intellect.",

His curriculum is a unique blend of melee combat, environmental awareness, and cunning, designed to turn a student's panic into a tactical advantage.\n\nKero specializes in teaching adventuring students how to use anything at their disposal as a weapon—a chair leg, a hot pie from the bakery next door, a bag of flour to blind an opponent. He drills them in using an enemy's weight against them, how to turn a shove into a fall down a flight of stairs, and how to always, always, be aware of the nearest exit.\n\nHis lessons are less about kata and more about controlled chaos. While he maintains a stern, disciplined exterior, he possesses a deep, quiet care for his students, many of whom come from the poorer parts of town and cannot afford traditional weapon training.\n\nTo Kero, every student who learns to land safely from a push or disarm a bully with a belt is a life improved, a personal victory in a world that often feels stacked against the little guy. He is teaching them that the most important roll they'll ever make is the one to avoid getting hit.",

A directive from the Dragon Council sees him spring into action with a speed that defies his biology, his shell suddenly no impediment to efficiently carrying out their every whim, be it serving an unjust eviction notice or shutting down a protest.\n\nThis stark contrast has led most citizens to a grim conclusion: Officer Laggard isn't incompetent; he is selectively, and strategically, slow.
